# linear-algebra
Collection of linear algebra operation implementations in different languages, to test speed differences and experiment with optimizations

Currently finished basic C implementation, will implement in Python next. 
Will compare run times to basic Python and the NumPy linear algebra implementation (Partially in Fortran)
